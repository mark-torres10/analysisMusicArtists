# Analysis of Music Artist Similarities
Analysis of the lyrics of music artists, to put them into groups. Project for Machine Learning class, Spring 2019.

## Goal: 

The goal of this project was to learn about word embeddings and to use word embeddings to compare the "similarity" of the lyrics of various artists. The data was provided pre-scraped as a part of the assignment. My contribution to the assignment was to write up the code that went into analyzing the lyrics. Code is my own. The attached PDF provides a knitted version of the R Markdown file.
